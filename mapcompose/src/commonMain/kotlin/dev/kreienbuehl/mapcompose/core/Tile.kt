/**
 * A [Tile] is defined by its coordinates in the "pyramid". A [Tile] is sub-sampled when the
 * scale becomes lower than the scale of the lowest level. To reflect that, there is [subSample]
 * property which is a positive integer (can be 0). When [subSample] equals 0, the [bitmap] of the
 * tile is full scale. When [subSample] equals 1, the [bitmap] is sub-sampled and its size is half
 * the original bitmap (the one at the lowest level), and so on.
